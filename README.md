# AIST_ProgrammingTest
 Unity Project for AIST programming test

 This project contains two scenes that complete the two tests assigned for the AIST programming test.

 The Test1_ForceSensorSimulation scene contains the results for test 1 where a force sensor is being simulated.

 The Test2_LeftRightGUI scene contains the results for test 2 where various inputs are enabled to be used to change the text in a GUI to either left or right.

 For either test simply open the scene and press play in order test the functionalty. 

 For the test 1 the arrows represent the simulated force sensors. They have simulated movement, orintation, and applied force. Various settings can be changed for this simulation via the SimulationSettings scriptable object located in the ScriptableObjects folder.

 For the test 2 when the scene is played various inputs can be used in order to control the text in the gui and to control the visibility of the GUI. The GUI's visibility can be controled by clicking the button in the top corner with the mouse, by pressing the o keyboard buttton to open or the c keyboard button to close, or by using the voice commands of open and close. The GUI text can be changed to either left or right by using the keyboard keys of L (for left) and R (for right), by clicking on the left and right buttons in the GUI, by using voice commands of left and right, or by using the left and right triggers on VR controllers. It is important to note that VR controllers have not been tested on because I do not own any.
